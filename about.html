            On-Ear Headphones (Supra-aural)
On-ear headphones, or Supra-aural headphones, provide a middle ground between the over-ear and earbud style. They rest comfortably on the outer ear, providing a comfortable fit without fully enclosing the ear. This design offers a balanced, natural sound quality while maintaining a relatively compact size. House of Marley's on-the-ear headphones are a shining example of this style. Crafted with superior materials and offering crystal-clear sound, these headphones ensure you stay connected to your favorite tunes without compromising on comfort. Their design is versatile enough for daily use, whether you're working, studying, or just relaxing. The on-ear design offers the benefit of ambient awareness, making them a safe choice for outdoor activities where you need to stay aware of your surroundings. With their combination of comfort, sound quality, and practicality, on-ear headphones are a popular choice for many musicÂ enthusiasts.
